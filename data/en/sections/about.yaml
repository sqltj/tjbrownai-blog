  I build intelligent systems and write about the future of technology. Focused on high-scale software architecture, LLMs, and innovative user experiences.
  
  I am particularly interested in the intersection of Data and AI, exploring platforms like Databricks and Microsoft Fabric to build modern data architectures.
